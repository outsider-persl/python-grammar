# '#' is used to comment a line
# this is a comment

# indentation is important in python
print("Hello, World!")

# input("Press Enter to continue...")
# print("Goodbye, World!")

# name = input("What is your name? \n")
# print("Hello, " + name + "!")

# Ask the user for their name
# name = input("What's your name? ")

# The print function automatically includes a piece of code end='\n'
# we can change this to end='' to prevent the print function from adding a new line
# print("hello,", end="")
# print(name)

# we can also use the escape character '\' to escape special characters
# print('hello, "friend"')

# Formatting Strings
# print(f"before, {name}","after")
# name = name.strip()  # remove leading and trailing whitespaces
# print(f"before, {name}","after")

title = "outsider"
title = title.title()  # capitalize the first letter of each word
print(title)
